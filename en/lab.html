                        <p>The institute has modern laboratories and drawing rooms to serve all disciplines. The architectural drawing rooms serve the students of the architecture department both junior and senior. These halls are well ventilated and the drawing boards are designed to provide health for the students while performing their tasks.</p>
                        <p>Some laboratories are dedicated for the service of the junior students in chemistry, physics (A), mechanics and computer labs, in the form of a local network connected to a main server linked to the Internet.</p>
                        <p>There are also engineering workshops for the junior students and raise their engineering abilities in a variety of fields, such as carpentry, electricity, plumbing, metal cutting, welding, foundry and forming.</p>
                        <p>The labs for serving the students of the Civil Engineering Department such as Soil Engineering, Concrete Engineering, Field Engineering, Hydraulics laboratories, etc. All these laboratories are equipped with a modern form to enable students to quickly and practically assimilate to simulate the global labor market.</p>
                        <p>There are also several laboratories for electrical, electronic and communications engineering. Especially designed labs are dedicated to computer engineering students covering both hardware and software approaches. The excellent and innovative teaching methodology necessary to the engineering field for developing the cognitive aspect of knowledge and for creating a well educated engineer capable of competing in novel fields such as artificial intelligence techniques and solution provider trends very much needed in the actual market.</p>
